#summary Zen Coding extension for Adobe Dreamweaver
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

Zen Coding is an editor plugin for high-speed HTML, XML, XSL (or any other structured code format) coding and editing. The core of this plugin is a powerful abbreviation engine which allows you to expand expressions—similar to CSS selectors—into HTML code. You can find more information on [http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/ project main page].


= How to install =
To install it you need to [http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/downloads/detail?name=Zen.Coding-Dreamweaver.v0.7.2.zip download zip-package] of the extension, unpack “Zen Coding v.0.7.2.mxp” and install it via Adobe Extension Manager. If file association with “.mxp” don't work you can access it under Commands menu in Dreamweaver.

Source is code also included there. You can make changes if you want and install mxi extension then.

After installing you need to restart Adobe Dreamweaver (or [http://help.adobe.com/en_US/dreamweaver/cs/extend/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d117f508c8de-7fd1.html reload extensions]) if it running.


= Whats new in version 0.7.2 =
  * Tab expanding now works with strict rules. If you are not editing HTML/CSS/XML code or selected text or caret is in tag no expanding will occur (except for CSS in style attribute) and normal tab will be inserted (or whatever in your settings). ([http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/issues/detail?id=231 Issue 231])
  * Abbreviations itself now also got stricter rules for expanding, thus fixing [http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/issues/detail?id=232 Issue 232] with CSS snippet expanding after opening curly brace.
  * Reworked menu commands shortcuts in order to try keep consistency with other plugins as much as possible. Sorry if you already accustomed to the old ones. I hope you will like it and quickly adapt to the new shortcuts. See [#Shortcuts_table] for information.
  * Also if you if you specify only the class or id for inline subelement in abbreviation it automatically will be `span` not `div` ([http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/issues/detail?id=227 Issue 227]).
  * As it was asked in comments “Merge Lines” without selection now automatically recognize blocks in CSS parsing mode (`{…}`). It correctly works with nested blocks and totally ignores braces in comments and quoted strings.
  * New action “Rename tag” were also added. It just changes a name of tag and leaves its attributes untouched. If it isn't enough for your “Wrap with abbreviation”/“Remove tag” combination is recommended.
  * “Insert Formatted Newline” action were (re-)added. Being executed between newly created opening and closing tags or curly brackets it breaks them to separate lines and puts caret into middle line with indentation.
  * Various indentation issues were also fixed.


= About Adobe Dreamweaver extension =

This extension contains all Zen Coding features which can be supported by editor extension engine. The bad news is that Dreamweaver doesn't have multiple tab stops and can't read image (binary) files. So related features like “encode to base64” aren't realized. Maybe someone will do it with C-level extensibility.

But the good news is that since version 0.7 *you can expand abbreviations with Tab button*! Also some new actions were added and almost all actions now have shortcuts.

= Actions and shortcuts =

Except Tab key you can expand abbreviations with “`Ctrl+,`” as before. Unfortunately it conflicts with hotkeys in some Dreamweaver localizations. If you faced with this issue you should manage hotkeys manually via Edit → Keyboard Shortcuts menu.

As for other shortcuts I tried to assign non-used ones. The two of them with Ctrl key: “`Ctrl+H`” and “`Ctrl+K`” were assigned to “Wrap with Abbreviation” and “Select Line”. With some others “Alt” key became very helpful because Dreamweaver doesn't allow to assign it via user interaction. (I suspect in order to avoid collisions with menu bar.) You can still assign your own shortcuts via Keyboard Shortcuts editor.

The only action without shortcut is “Balance Tag”. There are two reasons: outward (same by default) and inward versions of the action and similar function of Dreamweaver “Select Parent Tag” (“`Ctrl+[`”).

It can be located in source files (and then deployed with extension reinstall) or in “Commands\ZenCoding” folder under your [http://help.adobe.com/en_US/dreamweaver/cs/extend/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d117f508c8de-7fdb.html configuration folder]. You should [http://help.adobe.com/en_US/dreamweaver/cs/extend/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d117f508c8de-7fd1.html reload extensions] or restart Dreamweaver to make changes work.

For example to my_zen_settings.js were included next snippets:
