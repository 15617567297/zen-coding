#summary Using Zen Coding in Aptana/Eclipse
#labels Phase-Deploy

==Installing==
Zen Coding requires [http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Monkey_Overview EclipseMonkey] plugin to run. This plugin is bundled with Aptana by default. So, if you're using Aptana, you can skip first step.
  # Install EclipseMonkey using update site: http://download.eclipse.org/technology/dash/update (you can skip this step if you have Aptana installed)
  # Create top-level project in your current Eclipse workspace, name it, for example, *zencoding*
  # Create *scripts* folder inside newly created project
  # Extract contents of downloaded zip plugin into this folder. The project structure may look like this:
     http://zen-coding.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/aptana-proj-structure.png
  # Restart Eclipse/Aptana if needed
  
Now you should have Scripts menu item with Zen Coding in it.

==Changing keyboard shortcuts==
If you don't like default keyboard shortcuts, you can always change them. For example, if you wish to change "Expand Abbreviation" shortcut, you should open `Expand Abbreviation.js` file. At the top of this file you will see something like this:
{{{
/*
 * Menu: Zen Coding > Expand Abbreviation
 * Kudos: Sergey Chikuyonok (http://chikuyonok.ru)
 * License: EPL 1.0
 * Key: M3+E
 * DOM: http://download.eclipse.org/technology/dash/update/org.eclipse.eclipsemonkey.lang.javascript
 * 
 * @include "/EclipseMonkey/scripts/monkey-doc.js"
 * @include "lib/core.js"
 * @include "settings.js"
 */
}}}

There's a *Key* command describing current shortcut, which is `M3+E` in this case (`M3` stands for `Alt`). Just change this shortcut and save the file.
